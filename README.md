✨ Hi, I'm Nikita Ravi
AI Developer • Data Analyst • ML Researcher
Healthcare • Emergency Tech • Workforce Equity • Commerce Analytics
I’m Nikita, an AI & Data practitioner who loves building systems that solve meaningful, real-world problems — especially in public-facing domains where data-driven decisions can improve outcomes, efficiency, and access.
I specialize in combining AI (LLMs, RAG, FAISS) with data engineering & analytics pipelines to uncover hidden patterns, automate intelligence, and transform raw data into intuitive tools — dashboards, chatbots, and decision-support systems.
I thrive in environments where challenges are complex, data is messy, and the mission is impact.
If it requires problem-solving, creativity, fast learning, or end-to-end ownership, I’m all in.

🌟 About Me
I work at the intersection of AI-driven insights, data engineering, and public-impact analytics.
I’m deeply passionate about:
🩺 Healthcare AI — medical chatbots, clinical NLP, public health datasets
🚨 Emergency Tech — document triage pipelines, metadata extraction, escalation workflows
🛍️ Commerce & Customer Analytics — retention, segmentation, forecasting
🌍 Workforce Equity & Public Policy — ACS, BLS, HRSA dashboards & indicators
💬 Conversational AI — RAG systems, domain-tuned LLMs, retrieval pipelines
🔍 Hidden Pattern Detection — turning large datasets into insights
🎨 Data-to-Experience Engineering — Streamlit, ReactJS, Tableau, PowerBI
☁️ Cloud-Native Solutions — AWS, GCP, OCI, serverless pipelines
My goal is simple:
Use AI + Data to build tools that are not only smart — but useful.
