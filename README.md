✨ Hi, I'm Nikita Ravi
AI Developer • Data Analyst • ML Researcher

I’m Nikita, an AI & Data practitioner who loves building systems that solve meaningful, real-world problems — especially in public-facing domains where data-driven decisions can improve outcomes, efficiency, and access.
I specialize in combining AI (LLMs, RAG, FAISS) with data engineering & analytics pipelines to uncover hidden patterns, automate intelligence, and transform raw data into intuitive tools — dashboards, chatbots, and decision-support systems.
I thrive in environments where challenges are complex, data is messy, and the mission is impact.
If it requires problem-solving, creativity, fast learning, or end-to-end ownership, I’m all in.
