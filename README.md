## 👋 Hi, I'm Nikita Ravi
AI Developer | Data Analyst | ML Researcher
Healthcare • Emergency Tech • Workforce Equity • Commerce Analytics
I’m Nikita, an AI and Data professional who loves building systems that make life genuinely better for people. My work sits at the intersection of AI innovation and public-facing impact, where challenges are complex, data is messy, and solutions truly matter.
I’m passionate about solving problems in domains where analytics and decision-making save time, money, and sometimes lives — including healthcare, emergency response, public health policy, and customer behavior analytics.
My superpower is blending AI (LLMs, RAG, FAISS) with end-to-end data engineering to uncover hidden patterns, automate intelligence, and turn raw datasets into intuitive dashboards and real-time tools. Whether it’s building a clinical RAG chatbot, crafting large-scale dashboards in Streamlit/React/Tableau, or designing cloud pipelines on AWS, I’m always excited to take on challenges from 0 → 1.
I’m endlessly curious, impact-driven, and always looking to collaborate on ideas that push boundaries and create value.

🌟 About Me
I work at the intersection of AI-driven insights, data engineering, and public-impact analytics.
Some of the domains I care deeply about:
🩺 Healthcare AI — clinical NLP, medical chatbots, public health datasets
🚨 Emergency Response Tech — metadata extraction, document triage, escalation workflows
🛍️ Commerce & Customer Analytics — retention, segmentation, forecasting
📊 Workforce Equity & Public Policy Dashboards — ACS, BLS, HRSA data stories
💬 Conversational AI — RAG systems, domain-tuned LLMs, retrieval engines
🔍 Finding Hidden Patterns — mining large datasets and turning them into interactive insights
🎨 Data-to-Experience Engineering — Streamlit, ReactJS, Tableau, PowerBI dashboards
I enjoy taking messy, complex data problems and turning them into intelligent, usable systems that empower users—researchers, policymakers, emergency responders, and businesses alike.
